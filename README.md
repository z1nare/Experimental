## My solutions to AoC 2024
### About: During winter 2024, I participated in an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. 

#### I am proud to share that I won second most valuable reward in the local competition in AoC organized by [CompSoc](https://comp-soc.com/)
